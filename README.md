# portfolio-website
## Task Objectives
This project implements a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. The website serves as an online resume and a point of contact for potential employers or collaborators.
**Key Features:**

**About Section:**  A concise introduction about myself, including my background, interests, and career goals.
**Skills Section:**  A list of my technical (programming languages, frameworks, tools) and non-technical (communication, teamwork, problem-solving) skills.
**Projects Section:** A showcase of my top projects, each with a description, technologies used, links to live demos or GitHub repositories.
**Contact Form:**  A functional contact form allowing visitors to send me messages directly.
**Responsive Design:**  The website is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile devices).

## Tech Stack
***Frontend:** React.js (for component-based architecture and dynamic updates)
**Styling:**  CSS (with potential for a CSS-in-JS library like Styled Components or Emotion if complexity warrants it)
**Backend (Optional):** Node.js/Express.js (only if necessary for advanced contact form functionality, such as server-side validation or email sending - otherwise Formspree or a similar service will be used)
**Hosting:** Netlify or Vercel (for easy deployment and continuous integration)

## Steps to Run the Project
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [repository URL]
    cd portfolio-website
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```
3.  **Configure environment variables (if applicable):**

    *   If using a backend, you may need to set environment variables for database connections or API keys.  Consult the `.env.example` file (if provided) or the backend documentation.

4.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start  # or yarn start
    ```

    This will typically launch the website at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar address).

5.  **Build for production (optional):**

    ```bash
    npm run build  # or yarn build
    ```

    This will create an optimized production build in a `build` directory.  You can then deploy the contents of this directory to a web server (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3).

## Code Structure

The project follows a component-based architecture in React:

*   `src/`: Contains all the source code.
    *   `components/`: Reusable UI components (e.g., `About.js`, `Skills.js`, `ProjectCard.js`, `ContactForm.js`).
    *   `pages/`:  Different pages of the website (e.g., `Home.js`).
    *   `App.js`: The main application component that routes between pages.
    *   `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.
    *   `styles/`: CSS or styled components for the website.
    *   `data/`:  (Optional)  JSON files to store project data, skills lists, etc. to keep the components cleaner.
*   `public/`: Contains static assets (e.g., images, fonts).
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies files to be ignored by Git.
*   `package.json`:  Lists project dependencies and scripts.
*   `README.md`: This file.

## Functionality

*   **About Section:** Displays a professional headshot, a brief personal bio, and links to my social media profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).
*   **Skills Section:** Presents a visual representation of my skills, possibly using progress bars, icons, or tag clouds.  Categorizes skills into technical and non-technical areas.
*   **Projects Section:**  Each project is displayed as a card with a title, description, image, and links to the live demo and the GitHub repository (if applicable).
*   **Contact Form:** A user-friendly form with fields for name, email, and message.  Implements client-side validation to ensure correct input.  Submissions are handled using Formspree or a similar service, or, if necessary, a lightweight Node.js backend with Nodemailer to send emails.
*   **Responsive Design:** The website adapts to different screen sizes using media queries and a responsive grid layout.

## Innovation & Creativity
***Interactive Elements:** Incorporate subtle animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.
***Unique Visual Design:**  Strive for a visually appealing and modern design that reflects my personal brand.
*   **Performance Optimization:**  Optimize images and code for fast loading times.

## Documentation

The code is well-commented to explain the purpose of each component and function. The README file provides a comprehensive overview of the project structure, setup instructions, and key features.
